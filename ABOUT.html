<Div class="p1">
<p style="text-align: center;" >Karma is a really fluffy cat.<br></p>
<p>Karma was born on the 27th of April in the year 2017.<br></p>
<p>Karma has given birth to 14 kittens.<br></p>
<p>She has won many medals in cat beauty contests.<br></p>
<p>Karma really loves to lick plastic and play with gluey stuff.<br></p>
<p>She also loves when you give her candy and pet her on the head or scratch her neck.<br></p>
<p>When you open any drawer in the kitchen she thinks shes about to get candy and runs to the kitchen as fast as she can.<br></p>
<p>We bought her on the 14th of December in the year 2020.<br></p>
<p>Karma is loved by everyone she meets and is very lovely towards everyone.<br></p>
